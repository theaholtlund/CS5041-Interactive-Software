# Interactive Hardware and Software: The MicroHelper

This project is completed as part of the coursework assigned for "CS5041: Interactive Hardware and Software", at University of St Andrews. The project files can be used to configure a Micro:bit, so that it can be used as a tool to locate a person. The device is intended to be used as a security device, where one Micro:bit is placed with a user, and the other with a helper. The code from this repository is only for the website calibration, and must be accompanied with code to set up the Micro:bits.
